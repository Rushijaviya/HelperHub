## Problem Statement 
* We have to build something that will be helpful for the people, especially with respect to their neighbourhood.
* There is a lack of such software/web portal in which all people of a particular society can connect with themselves.
* They can connect via different means but not on a same portal.


## Solution
* We have created a hub - a web portal that consists of people with different types of occupation such as a service provider, tutor,doctor, logistic or any other occupation.
* They can log-in as a seeker or be a part of the Helper Hub by creating his/her profile.
* Once their profile is created, their names will be displayed on our “Hub”, so that anyone can contact them easily.
* Hence by this means, anyone can know about each other and contact them whenever necessary, rather than finding someone stranger for work.

## Impact
* This project will have a good impact upon the society.
* Every person can become more friendly with their neighbourhood.
* They can contact doctor, tutor, logistic services or any other service provider in their neighbour whenever needed
